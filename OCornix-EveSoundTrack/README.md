This mod was made possible by Kyle's OriginalSoundTrack mod, so huge thanks there.

Obviously, all songs used in this mod were made by, and belong to; Eve, so please do check him out. Eve is a Japanese singer/songwriter, most well known for songs such as Dramaturgy, Kaikai Kitan, and more. Although, as I'm writing this description of Eve, I realize that if you've clicked on this mod, the chances that you already know who Eve is are quite high.



This is my first ever mod, even if I'm piggybacking off of Kyle, we all have to start somewhere.

Anywho, I hope you enjoy.
